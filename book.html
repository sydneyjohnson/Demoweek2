<p>It is not the purpose of this book to try to
establish a claim for printing that it is an art.
It is hoped that it may show that the principles
of art may be applied to printing, and that
such application may lead to improvement in
some essentials of printing.</p>

<p>Thanks are due to several experts in printing
who have read the proofs, and have given
wise and acceptable counsel.</p>

<p>I desire to acknowledge that aid has been
freely sought from books upon art, and that in
some instances forms of expression have been
adopted from them. No originality is claimed
for the allusions to art, nor for art terms and
formulas employed.</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <h6>Chapter I</h6>
<h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
</div>

<div class="p1">
<p class="in0 drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Because</span> it is difficult to perfectly
transfer a thought from
one mind to another it is essential
that the principal medium
through which such transference
is accomplished may be as perfect as it is possible
to make it.</p>

<p>It is not wholly by means of the literal significance
of certain forms of words that ideas
are given currency, whether the words are
spoken or printed. In speaking it is easy to
convey an impression opposed to the literal
meaning of the words employed, by the tone,
the expression, the emphasis. It is so also with
printed matter. The thought or idea to be communicated
acquires or loses force, directness,
clearness, lucidity, beauty, in proportion to the
fitness of the typography employed as a medium.</p>

<p>It is not primarily a question of beauty of
form that is essential in printing, but of the
appropriateness of form. Beauty for itself alone
is, in printing, but an accessory quality, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
considered as an aid to the force and clarity of
the substance of the printed matter.</p>

<p>An object of art illustrating forms and expressions
of beauty subtly suggests esthetic or
sensuous emotions, which play upon the differing
consciousnesses of beholders as their capacities
and natures enable them to appreciate
it. The impulse received from the art object is
individually interpreted and appropriated, and
its value to the individual is determined by each
recipient, in accord with his nature, training,
and capacity.</p>

<blockquote>It is not primarily a question of beauty of
form that is essential in printing, but of the
appropriateness of form.</blockquote>

<p>The motive of a piece of printing is driven
into the consciousness of the reader with brutal
directness, and it is one of the offices of the
typographer to mitigate the severity of the message
or to give an added grace to its welcome.</p>

<p>The book has become such a force as had
not been dreamed of a generation ago. The
magical increase in the circulation of books, by
sale and through libraries, is one of the modern
marvels. It is inevitable that the gentle and
elevating influence of good literature will be
greater and broader in proportion to the increase
of the reading habit, for despite the great
amount of triviality in literature the proportion
of good is larger than ever before, and the
trivial has not as large a proportion of absolute
badness. The critical are prone to underrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
the influence of what they esteem trivial literature
upon the lives of the people who read
little else. It is certain that there is some good
in it, and that it affects the lives of those who
read it. Even the most lawless of the bandits
of the sanguinary novels has a knightly strain
in his character, and his high crimes and misdemeanors
are tempered with a certain imperative
code of homely morality and chivalry.
The spectacular crimes are recognized by the
majority of readers as the stage setting for the
tale—the tabasco sauce for the literary pabulum.
They are not considered to be essential
traits of admirable character. The cure for the
distemper it is supposed to excite resides in the
sensational literature of the day; it is as likely
to lead to better things, it may be, as it is likely
to deprave.</p>

<p>The cultivating power of any book is enhanced
if it is itself an object of art. If it is made
in accord with the principles of art, as they are
applicable to printing and binding, it will have
a certain refining influence, independent of its
literary tendency.</p>

<p>If we are to subscribe to the best definition
of esthetics, we are bound to recognize in the
physical character of the books that are read
by masses of people a powerful element for artistic
education, and one lending itself to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
educational propaganda with ready acquiescence
and inviting eagerness.</p>

<p>The business and the mechanics of printing
have attained a high degree of perfection. The
attention bestowed upon the machinery of
business, the perfection of systems and methods,
has brought commercial and mechanical
processes to a degree of perfection and finish
that leaves slight prospect of further improvement,
more illuminating systems, or more exact
methods. The business of printing is conducted
in a manner undreamt of by the men who
were most consequential a generation ago. Only
a few years have passed since the methods that
now control in the counting-rooms of the larger
printshops were unknown. Now all is system;
knowledge, by the grace of formulas and
figures.</p>

<p>A like condition prevails in the work rooms:
in the composing-room and the pressroom.
The processes incident to printing have been
improved, in a mechanical way, until little is
left for hope to feed upon. The trade of the
printer has been broken into specialized units.
The "all 'round" printer is no more. In his
place there is the hand compositor, the "ad"
compositor, the job compositor, the machine
operator, the make-up man, the pressman, the
press feeder, etc., each a proficient specialist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
but neither one a printer. To further mechanicalize
the working printers, the planning of the
work has been largely taken into the counting-room,
or is done in detail at the foreman's
desk. So every influence has been at work to
limit the versatility and kill the originality of
the man at the case. The compensatory reflection
is the probability that the assembly of
results accomplished by expert units may be a
whole of a higher grade of excellence.</p>

<p>The process of specialized improvement has
been carried through all the mechanical departments,
and has had its way with every machine
and implement, revolutionizing them and their
manipulation also. The time is ripe for a new
motive of improvement and advance to become
operative. The mechanical evolution may well
stay its course. It has far outstripped the artistic
and the intellectual motives. It is quite
time to return to them and bring them up to
the point reached by the mechanics of the craft,
if it be found not possible to put them as far
in advance as their relative importance seems
to demand.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to conclude that certain
principles of art have been influential in printing
since the craft was inaugurated by Gutenberg
and Fust and their contemporaries, but
it appears that the relation between printing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
and the graphic arts has not yet been fully and
consciously acknowledged. Some of the older
rules and principles of printing are in perfect
harmony with the principles and rules of art,
and undoubtedly had their origin in the same
necessity for harmony that lies in human nature
and that was the seed of art principles.</p>

<p>Printing touches life upon so many of its facets,
and is such a constant constituent of it, that
it requires no special plea to raise it to the
plane of one of the absolute forces of culture
and one of the most important elements of
progress. This postulate admitted, and the plea
for the fuller recognition of the control of art
principles in printing needs to be pressed only
to the point of full recognition, and it requires
no stretch of indulgent imagination to find
printing successfully asserting a claim to be recognized
as an art. It is manifest that printing
is not an art in the sense that painting is an art.
Painting has no utilitarian side. It is, with it,
art or nothing. Printing is 99–100ths utilitarian.
It is essentially a craft. If there is a possibility
latent in it of development of true art through
refinement and reform in its processes, and
the application of art principles, to the end
that the possibility of the production of occasional
pieces that can demonstrate a claim to
be art be admitted, it is all that can be hoped.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
This is claiming for printing only that which
is conceded to the other crafts. There is no
claim put forward for silversmiths that their
work is all artistic; the chief part of it is very
manifestly craftsmanship, yet examples that
are true art constantly appear. The same is
true of wood carving, of repoussé work in metals,
and of many crafts. It may be true of printing,
and will be when printers themselves become
qualified to view their craftsmanship from
the point of view of the artist, and feel for it
that devotion which is always the recognizable
controlling motive of artists in other graphic
arts, and in those crafts that verge upon the
graphic arts.</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <h6>Chapter II</h6>
<h3 id="ch_1">Art in Printing</h3>
</div>

<div class="p1">
<p>There is this vital difference
between other objects of art
and printing: That our association
with them is purely
voluntary, and that printing
forces itself upon us at all times and in every
relation of life. It is impossible for a person of
intelligence to remove himself from the influence
of printing. It confronts him at every
turn, and in every relation of life it plays an
important and insistent part.</p>

<p>Such examples of art as a painting or a piece
of statuary exert a certain influence upon a
restricted number of persons; and it is at all
times optional with all persons whether they
submit themselves to the influence of such art
objects. We are able to evade the influence of
other forms of art, but we are not able to ward
off printing. To it we must submit. It is constantly
before our eyes; it is forever exerting
its power upon our consciousness. It is quite
possible that we may not at present be able
to refer any quality of mind, or any degree of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
cultivation, directly to printing, in any form it
may have been presented to us; but it is easily
conceivable that printing has a certain influence
upon our esthetic life which has been so constant
and so habitual as to have escaped definite
recognition.</p>

<p>If we engage our minds in some attempt to
realize the quality and extent of pleasure and
profit derivable from the constant influence of
printing that conforms to artistic principles, we
may perceive that it may be a most powerful
and effectual agency for culture. It is understood
that it is the gentle but constant influence
that moulds our habits and lives the more
readily and lastingly. If therefore it is possible
for us to conceive that the printed page of a
book may illustrate and enforce several of the
more elemental and important principles underlying
graphic art, we may thereby realize
that printing may readily be employed in the
character of a very powerful art educator, if because
of certain inalienable limitations it must
be denied full recognition as a member of the
sisterhood of arts.</p>

<blockquote>If we engage our minds in some attempt to
realize the quality and extent of pleasure and
profit derivable from the constant influence of
printing that conforms to artistic principles, we
may perceive that it may be a most powerful
and effectual agency for culture.</blockquote>

<p>The book page may be regarded as the protoplasm
of all printing. If we examine the relation
of principles of art to the book page we
will be able to appreciate the exact importance
of those principles in the composition of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
other form of printing, and to so apply them
as to secure results most nearly relating printing
to graphic art.</p>

<p>It is the chief characteristic of this uncertain
dogma of art in printing that its limitations
and variations defy the conventional forms of
expression, and almost require a new vocabulary
of art terms. It assuredly requires a new
and a different comprehension of the terms of
art, and a distinctly varied comprehension of
the word art itself. It has ever been a stumbling
block to printers that the word art as
applied to their craft must be given a more
limited significance than is given it in its usual
acceptance. If we can come at some intelligible
appreciation of what we mean by art in printing
the way will be opened for the application
of that motive to the work of the presses.</p>

<p>If we recognize at once the fact that we do
not mean exactly what a painter means when
we use the word art with reference to printing,
we will have taken the vital step toward a comprehensible
employment of the term, as well
as qualified ourselves for an understanding of
the results we desire to achieve.</p>

<p>It is essential that we do not fall into the error
of supposing that scientific accuracy is art.
It is destructive of art, and the temptation to
put too much stress upon exactitude is a mistake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
the printer must guard himself from with
the most sedulous care. It is agreeable to recognize
the touch of the artist, in printing as
in other arts, and scientific accuracy is certain
to obliterate individuality. It is not the cold,
lifeless abstraction, the shining exemplar of all
the precepts and rules of art, that we love and
desire, but the human note speaking through
the principles and rules. If the artist is not the
dominant note, and the rules submerged by
the personality, there is no value in the object
of art. The picture is interesting because the
artist expresses through it his appreciation, his
interpretation, of a beautiful thought or a lovely
thing. This is what puts the most faithful
photographs outside of the pale of art, and compels
the idealization of the performance of the
camera before it can be considered to be artistic.
The photograph is not, usually, true to
our view of life. If it is indeed true to life it represents
a view of life that is quite strange to us,
and often distasteful. We are not familiar with
the uncouth animal the photograph shows us
the horse in action to be, and we will not accept
that caricature as the real horse. The horse that
is real to us is the animal we see with our eyes,
and the horse in art must be the animal we see
plus the artist's logical idealization. The facts
are the same with regard to nearly all of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
work of the camera, and with regard to other
attempts at scientific accuracy in art. It is foreign
to our experience, and does violence to
our ideals. We actually see no such automatons
as photography shows us men in action are,
and we can never accept such disillusionment.
If it is attempted in the name of art we will
turn upon art and throw it out of our lives.</p>

<p>It is the irredeemable fault of some processes
employed in printing that they are too
scientifically accurate. This is the legitimate argument
against the halftone plate as contrasted
with the line engraving or the reproductions
of pen-and-ink work, etc. The halftone is too
accurate. It brings us face to face with the stark
reality, and brushes away all the kindly romance
nature has made a necessary adjunct to
our powers of vision. Attempts to restore this
quality to halftones with the graver are only
partially successful, as the defect is too deep
seated, too radically fundamental. Some other
processes, other than reproductive processes,
employed in printing are exposed to this danger
of too much scientific accuracy, producing
results that have no warmth, no sympathy, no
human power. Printing is peculiarly the victim
of this cold formality of sentiment, and must
be considered as upon that plane. But this fact
makes the obligation to be alive to every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
opportunity to mitigate its severity the more
pressing upon every printer who dreams of his
work as of an art, and the closer the sympathy
between the printer and the culture of art the
more warmth and humanity he will be able to
infuse into his work.</p>

<p>Some of the principles of art have a fundamental
relation to printing, while some have
an influence upon it so illusive as to defy definition,
and compel us to look upon the connection
as something no more substantial than
feeling. Indeed, the whole matter of the application
of art principles to printing may not
unfairly be considered to be one of feeling; involving
the saturation of the printer with the
rules and tenets of art and the adding thereto
of a fine discrimination tempered by a resolute
philistinism, and then the play of his cultivated
individuality upon the typography.</p>

<p>Principles and rules of art for the printer's
guidance must be more mobile than can be
permitted for the guidance of the painter, the
draughtsman, the engraver, or the sculptor, because
the medium for the expression of the
printer's conception is so nearly immobile. It
is the reverse of the general conception: The
rule must adapt itself to the medium and to
the circumstances, at least so far as the measure
of its observance is concerned, if not in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
emergencies where its principle is also at stake.
It is conceivable in printing that emergencies
may occur making it imperative to ignore the
primary rules of composition, of proportion,
of balance, or of perspective; it may be necessary
to even do violence to principles relating
to color or to tone. Such emergencies must be
exceedingly rare, but that we are forced to regard
them as possible emphasizes the subtle
difference between art and art in printing. There
can be no good art if the principles of art are
violated in execution; there may be good printing
if the principles of art are occasionally modified
or even ignored.</p>

<p>The motive of printing is not primarily an
art motive. It is a utilitarian motive. In printing
therefore art is to be invoked for guidance
only so far as it will lend itself to the expression
of the motive. It is never, in printing,
"art for art's sake"; it is ever art for printing's
sake. We do not print to illustrate art, nor to
produce objects of art. We print to spread intelligence—to
make knowledge available to
all who will read. A painted picture, if of a high
order of art, is meant to appeal to a sentiment
but slightly connected with the "story" of the
picture. The appreciative observer of a good
painting gives little thought to the "story," to
the literary motive, but is absorbed in seeking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
for the artistic motive, in order that he may
yield himself to the charm of the work of art;
he seeks "art for art's sake."</p>

<p>In printing it is the "story" that is told;
it is the literary motive that must be considered,
first and most anxiously. Nothing may
interfere—not even art. The shaft of the
"story" must go, swift and true, straight into
the comprehension of the reader. This is the
constant anxiety of the printer. The literary
motive must not be encumbered. It must be
freed from the mechanics of the printed page
absolutely. This is the printer's problem. He
must not seek to attract to his mechanics. It
is the essence of his art that he liberate ideas
and send them forth with no ruffled pinions,
no evident signs of the pent-house page from
which they wing their way.</p>

<p>The printer's work and the painter's art exactly
reverse their processes, as their motives
are opposed; but they must both work with the
same tools, measurably. Everything with the
painter is plastic, except his art. Everything is
immobile with the printer, except his art; and
of that he hopes to employ only so much as
will gild the prosaic commercialism of the motive
he must express. The chief principles and
tenets of art are all applicable to the craft of
printing, in some degree. Drawing, composition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
harmony, balance, proportion, perspective,
color, tone, light-and-shade, values, etc.,
are qualities of graphic art that apply to printing
with varying force, according to the exigencies
of each particular case in hand, and
particularly according to the comprehension
and cultivation of the printer. It is always possible
to explain the beauty and power of any
piece of printing by reference to the same principles
that are responsible for the excellencies
of other works of graphic art. It is therefore
logical to assume that those principles which
explain the excellencies of printing are responsible
for them.</p>

<blockquote>The printer's work and the painter's art exactly
reverse their processes, as their motives
are opposed; but they must both work with the
same tools, measurably.</blockquote>

<p>It is evident that the value of these art qualities
in printing must depend upon the care
and intelligence exercised in their application.
They are refinements upon the usual and primary
practices of printing, and unless they can
be employed with full sympathy and knowledge,
as well as with the artistic spirit and comprehension,
they will appeal to the printer in
vain.</p>

<p>The question with the printer is: Is it worth
while to give my work all the beauty and distinction
and power possible? If it is decided
that it is profitable to execute work as worthily
as it is possible to execute it, the printer will
not be satisfied if he does not devote himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
to a study of this phase of his craft, and a study
of sufficient breadth and thoroughness to give
him a reliable basis of knowledge and the resultant
self-confidence. Having proceeded thus
far he will not fail to apply all these art tenets
to the full extent of his knowledge and their
adaptability.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23–25]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
  <h6>Chapter III</h6>
<h3 id="ch_2">Pictorial Composition</h3>
</div>

<div class="p1">
<p>While too much science is
often deadly to art, the true
basis of pictorial composition
is rigidly scientific, and
all of the principles governing
it are of use and importance to the printer,
especially in planning displayed work and in
title pages.</p>

<p>Composition is that quality which gives a
picture coherence, "the mortar of the wall."
It was not esteemed of importance by the old
masters, and many of their works do not show
that they knew or cared for that which distinguishes
a picture from a map, a group photograph,
or a scientific diagram. It is the absence
of composition, balance, unity, that makes ordinary
photographs something other than true
works of art. It is not primarily truth of representation
that is necessary in a work of art,
but truth of idealization; and that quality is beyond
the conscious reach of the camera's lens.
It is a redeeming and a justifying element added
by the imagination of the artist. There may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
be a picture, by a photographer or by a painter,
having all the requisite component parts to
make it a work of art; there may be, for example,
a woman, an axe, a road, a mountain,
trees; but these thrown together upon a canvas
do not make a work of art unless they are
properly composed, even if they are arranged
in an order satisfying to the realist, and each
faultlessly executed. It is not the same thing
to paint and to make pictures; to print and to
execute artistic printing.</p>

<blockquote>Composition is that quality which gives a
picture coherence, "the mortar of the wall."</blockquote>

<p>The application of the rules of composition
to pieces of printing made up in a whole or in
part of "display" types is obviously essential
to their beauty. It is the touch of beauty given
to science that produces art. In printing the
matter of securing balance and unity is at once
more simple and more difficult than in painting.
The component parts to be dealt with are
more rigid and restricted, but are purely conventional
and precise. The painter's conception
is given balance and unity through the
original drawing and color-scheme corrected
and perfected by constant scrutiny and by tests
and continual alterations. The printed piece
must be balanced by a wise choice and skilful
arrangement of the types, and a careful distribution
of white space and black ink, or color.
The actual center of a canvas is the center<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
of attraction in a picture perfectly balanced.
This does not mean that an equal amount of
paint must be spread upon every quarter of
the canvas, nor that objects of equal visual importance
in themselves must be equally distributed
over it. A tiny dot of distinctive paint,
placed a certain distance from the center of the
canvas, may perfectly balance an object ten
times its size which is placed relatively nearer
the center. Balance in printing must not be understood
to mean that there must be an equal
distribution of weight over all quarters of the
piece, but that there must be a compensatory
distribution of weight.</p>

<p>In his lucid and interesting book upon "Pictorial
Composition" Mr. H. R. Poore gives
a series of "postulates" which embody his ideas
upon the subject, and are expressed in terms
intelligible to the non-artistic as well as to those
whose familiarity with art enables them to
grasp more technical phrases. To the printer
it is only necessary to suggest that he interpret
"units" as meaning features in his work
and he will be able to appreciate that these art
rules may not infrequently stand him in good
stead, especially when he is perplexed with
some piece of work that he is having difficulty
in making "look right." Those of Mr. Poore's
"postulates" that appear to apply easily to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
printing, and may be more profitably studied
and heeded by printers and others interested
in typography, are here given:</p>

<li>All pictures are a collection of units.</li>

<p>In the application of the rules of composition
to graphic art it is possible to minutely subdivide
the topic and refer to specific examples
and explicit rules for practice. The selection of
the particular kind of balance to be sought depends
upon the placement of the important
item or subject, which is in itself chiefly important
in the scheme of balance as giving the keynote,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
furnishing the starting point. There is the
balance of equal measures, which is a picture
or piece of printing which may be cut into four
equal parts, by horizontal and vertical lines
drawn through its center, with each part showing
equal weight; the balance of isolated measures,
where the chief item is placed away from
the center and has one or more isolated spots
to compensate, skilfully placed; the horizontal
balance; the vertical balance; the formal
balance; the balance by opposition of light and
dark measures; balance by gradation; balance
of isolation, and other varieties of balance more
technical and more especially adapted to the
painter's uses. Each of these variants of the
basic rules of composition may be of special
value to the printer, if he studies the subject
sufficiently to gain a clear comprehension of
how each applies in printing.</p>

<blockquote>In the application of the rules of composition

<p>This is one of the art subjects that the practical
printer may deem of too slight consequence
to merit his careful attention. But if it is
desired to produce printing of power—power
to pleasurably attract the eye of those persons
who possess either an instinctive or a cultivated
taste for art—it is essential that the work adhere
closely to the rules governing pictorial
composition. The eye is a relentless judge.
Here, as in all printing, the esthetic motive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
is identical with the business consideration.
There is a double motive for the best printing,
the esthetic and the business motive, and it is
impossible to separate them, or consider either
apart from the other. It is unnecessary to attempt
to evade the force and meaning of the
new appreciation of the basis of good printing,
as it leads so surely to financial as well as esthetic
betterment, and should be congenial to
the tastes of every printer who has advanced in
his craft beyond the standards of the wood-sawyer.</p>

  <h6>Chapter IV</h6>
<h3 id="ch_3">Type Composition</h3>
</div>

<div class="p1">
<p>The composition of type is the
first task an apprentice is required
to undertake when he
goes to "learn the trade," and
his ideas regarding its importance
rarely rise above the level of the drudgery
of his early days at the case. But little of the
effort to improve the quality of printing has as
yet extended back to this primary proceeding,
the setting of the type, yet in this fundamental
operation lies the possibility for very great improvement
and distinction, and for lamentable
failure.</p>

<p>Progress in typography has been slower, and
it has reached a less advanced position, than
have other branches of the printing craft. Presswork
for example has become so nearly perfect
as to leave little room for the exercise of the
critic's art; and the choice and manipulation of
paper leaves little hope for radical advance.
Type is set as it was set one, two, three generations
ago, for the most part. A few printers
have given this subject special study, and are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
executing book pages that are the wonder and
despair of the craft. Their distinction has been
rather easily won. It is quite possible to detect
the source of it, and not difficult to draw the
same results from the same fount.</p>

<p>It has become a habit to accept the composed
page of type as the foundation upon
which to erect a fine piece of printing. The
real foundation lies somewhat further back.
There can scarcely be distinction in a printed
piece unless its source is in the successive steps
of progress that antedate the composition of
the type. The final artistic result must be clearly
conceived in the mind of the printer before
he drops one type into the stick. His scheme
must be fully developed, and it must be consistent
in all its details.</p>

<p>The type for a piece of printing should be
selected to give adequate expression to the literary
motive, to properly emphasize the subject
matter, with the view to the production of
a handsome and worthy piece of printing. To
secure this latter quality in printing is the primary
object of the typesetter, and therein lies
the proof of his skill and of his taste. Whether
the type selected is the best possible for a
given piece of work may be a debatable question,
but however it succeeds or fails in this
particular, the printer may manipulate it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
such a manner as will result in a consistent and
artistic example of typography. He may use
the sizes which should be in conjunction; he
may avoid the common anachronism of lower-case
and capital-letter lines in the same piece;
he may place his white space so that it will not
only be agreeably proportioned to the black or
other color of the print but so that it will be
as important an element of strength as the ink-covered
surface; he may adjust the margins.</p>

<p>These points are all vital, but none of them
more so than the use of lower-case and capital-letter
lines in conjunction. The capital letters
of the ordinary font of type do not lend themselves
gracefully to the making of complete
words. They are not designed for such work.
The lower-case letters are designed to stand together,
but it is impossible to combine many
capital letters without making noticeable gaps
and breaks and some awkward connections. But
the objection to capital-letter lines in conjunction
with lower-case lines does not rest chiefly
upon this point. There are fonts of type from
which capital-letter lines scarcely subject to the
criticism suggested may be set. The objection
is not urged against capital-letter lines in a prohibitive
sense, but because their intrusion in a
company of lower-case lines destroys harmony.
A like deplorable effect is produced by the use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
of inharmonious series of type for the same
piece of typography. The war of styles of type
is as destructive to artistic effect as the poorest
execution can be. In the old days the apprentice
was taught to alternate lower-case and capital-letter
lines in job printing, and avoid using
two lines of the same series in conjunction.</p>

<p>No one of the small refinements which are
now being applied to composition has worked
so radical an improvement as the newer ideas
relative to spacing, and the perception that the
spacing between words, the leading between
lines, and the degree of blackness of the face
of the letter, must have a balanced relation.
This has operated to abolish the conventional
em quadrat after the period, and to produce a
page of type-matter which lends itself readily
to securing tone and optical comfort.</p>

<p>The activity and the fecundity of the type
founders in producing new type faces has operated,
in the first instance, to furnish new excuse
for discord. Then a reaction began, and the
liberality of the founders in making complete
lines and elaborate series of type faces is suggesting
uniformity in scheme and supplying
material for consistent execution. The elaborate
specimen books are scarcely a temptation
to restraint however, nor do they tempt to classicism.
Too much type at the hand of the printer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
is a positive detriment. Until quite recently a
very large proportion of the new faces had no
warrant for existence. They were abortions,
based upon the fantastic ideas of designers who
exhibited little knowledge of art or of history.
The more recent product of the foundries is
much more creditable, and it appears that the
designing of type has been taken in hand by
artists of capacity, who are actuated by motives
worthy of their ambitions and guided by historical
research that is true in aim if not always
profound.</p>

<p>The typographic tendency is distinctly toward
better things. It lags, however. It is not
on the level of the other processes of printing.
We are yet compelled to admit that presswork
is far ahead of composition in development, as
is the facility for compounding and handling
inks and the selection and the manipulation
of paper.</p>

<p>In this vitally fundamental matter we have
made little real progress. The disciples of better
things are not honored with a following.
They are regarded with mild interest by a few
of the more progressive ones, with distinct disapproval
by the many conservatives, and with
utter indifference by the mass. Yet they will
win. That there is impending a considerable reform
in the composition of type is certain, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
the reform will consist in the general adoption
of the refinements now practiced by a few: In
a closer study of the matter of spacing and leading,
with a view to bringing the tone of the
page up to near the artistic requirements; in a
better balance between body type and chapter
and page headings; in a better, more consistent
and uniform management of the folio; in
order that those features may be actually the
guiding and subsidiary features in typography
that they assuredly are in the literary scheme of
the book.</p>

<p>The time is coming when a book page will
be planned to harmonize with and express the
literary motive; to promote ease and pleasure
in reading; and to satisfy the innate sense of
artistic harmony which is felt and appreciated
by the cultivated reader, even if, as must often
be the fact, he is quite unconscious of the existence
of such a demand.</p>

<p>It is upon a basis somewhat like this that
books should be planned: Make one page that
meets the requirements of art and of the literary
motive, and base the book upon it. Such is
not the general custom. It is more the fashion
to fix the size of the book and accommodate the
page to the arbitrary scheme, forcing the type
and the format to adequate proportions. There
are books that are artistically ruined by the use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
of type of an inharmonious face, or that may
be one size too small or too large; there are
many books that are, typographically, abortions,
because of neglect to conform to certain
very simple tenets of art, when they might as
easily have been exemplars of artistic motives
and a comfort and delight to each cultivated
reader.</p>

<p>It is doubtless because these neglected essentials
are so simple and so easily incorporated
that it is so difficult to obtain recognition
and currency for them. But we may rejoice that
books are beginning to receive some of this
kind of attention, even in the big printing factories,
where books are made very much as
barrels of flour are turned out of the great
northwestern mills, or as bags of grain are
discharged from the modern reapers marching
in clattering procession over the horizon-wide
wheat townships.</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <h6>Chapter V</h6>
<h3 id="ch_4">Proportion and the Format</h3>
</div>

<div class="p1">
  <p>It is a delicate and essential matter
to fix upon the length of the
type page, and a difficult question
to fix the margins. There is
a mass of literature bearing upon
these matters, but they cannot in every case be
decided according to arbitrary rules. It is usually
safe to be guided by the usual rules in proportioning
a page of type, and in placing the
page upon the paper. A thorough understanding
of the principles of art as they may be
applied to printing will suggest occasional infractions
of mechanical rules in the interests of
good art. Exactly what is to be the procedure
in every instance cannot be formulated into
rules, but it is always possible to explain justifiable
infractions of rules by reference to principles
of art. When it is found impossible to
thus justify departures from rule, precedent
or convention, it is evident that art would have
gained if the rules had been adhered to.</p>

<p>The treatment of the format of a book has
become somewhat of a moot question, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
it is evident that the advocates of the strictly
conventional method are gradually drawing
practical printers into agreement with them,
and that their opponents rely upon the spirit
of philistinism for their chief justification, confining
their arguments largely to contradiction
unfortified by either logic or precedent. Philistinism
is not entirely evil, but the present is
not a time of such slavish conformity as to
clothe it with the appearance of a virtue. Protest
is the instinctive spirit of today. In printing
there is too much of it. We need more conformity,
if conformity be interpreted not to
mean blind adherence to precedent but a large
and active faith in the saving virtue of demonstrable
principles.</p>

<p>Proportion, balance, in a limited sense composition
as understood in art, and optics must
be considered in adjusting the format of a book.
The size and shape of the book must determine
the exact dimensions of the page and the
margins. The leaf of the ordinary book which is
generally approved is fifty per cent longer than
it is wide. This proportion is often varied, and
for different reasons, but it may be accepted as
a standard.</p>

<p>The margins of a correctly printed book are
not equal. The back margin is the narrowest,
the top a little wider than the back, the front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
still wider, and the bottom, or tail margin, the
widest of all. Why this scheme for margins has
grown to be authoritative, and adopted by good
bookmakers, is not entirely clear. Nearly all
the literature upon the subject is devoted to attempts
to justify the custom instead of explaining
its origin. The best justification that can
now be offered is the evident fact that the custom
is agreeable to publishers, to authors, and
to discriminating readers.</p>

<p>It is often alleged that there is some law of
optics that is in agreement with the custom,
but it might be difficult to establish such a claim
though it is not necessary to attempt to refute
it. We are accustomed to this arrangement of
the margins in the best books, and that to which
we have become accustomed requires no defense,
scarcely an explanation. It is certain that
the format of a book appeals to us as right only
where this arrangement of unequal margins
is strictly observed. It is easy to imagine that
our eyes rest more contentedly upon the pair
of pages before them when those pages incline
toward the top of the leaves and toward each
other. The eye of the bookish person is undeniably
better satisfied if the margins are proportioned
as specified. There may be grounds for
doubting the claim that the reasons for such
satisfaction are optical; there are some plausible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
arguments to support such a contention. It is
a question for oculists.</p>

<p>The other reasons for the evolution of the
book format into its present form are logical.
If they do not lead to the conclusion that art
has been served and justified in full they assuredly
do not lead to a contrary conclusion.
The early paper makers produced a sheet that
was uneven in shape and variable in size, and
the pressman was compelled to make large allowance
on the front and tail margins. The
back and top margins could be reckoned, as
when the sheet was folded by the print they
would be uniform. The front and tail margins
were made wide enough to allow for the unevenness
of the paper and for the trim. It was
inevitable that the allowance should be too
great, and that to preserve the proper form and
proportion for the book the front and tail margins
should occasionally be left wider than the
back and head margins. This, it may be imagined,
did much to fix the present custom.
The ancient handmade papers were thicker
on the fore edge of the sheet than in the center,
and as the bookbinder could not beat the
edges flat they had to be trimmed off.</p>

<p>In the old days books were taken more seriously
than they now are, and studious readers
desired to annotate their copies of favorite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
books. The front and tail margins were used
for this purpose, and they were therefore given
their larger proportion of the sheet. In the fifteenth
century this motive for wide margins
was recognized by all printers, and many of
them went so far as to provide printed annotations
for all four of the margins.</p>

<p>There were other motives for fixing the
margins as we have them. Whether the optical
and the artistic motives, purely as such, may
explain the modern format more logically than
the historical motives do, may be debatable.
The question is not vitally important. We wish
to see the format of our books made as the
best practice makes it, whether our taste is inherited
as a habit or is acquired through our
artistic cultivation.</p>

<p>Accepting therefore the dictum as it stands,
without pressing an inquiry as to its authority
or its legitimacy, it remains something of a
problem to fix the margins and place the page
of a book. When all suggestions and rules are
considered it will be found that it is not often
that the ordinary book page will submit gracefully
to variation of the rule that the length be
determined by cutting the page into two triangles,
the hypotenuse of either of which shall
be twice the width of the page. The page-heading
should be included in this measurement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
but if the folio is placed at the foot, either in
bare figures or enclosed within brackets, it need
not be included. This formula must often be
disregarded, especially when the book is not to
be proportioned in conventional dimensions.
No other form is as satisfactory however, and
it is quite within the bounds of the practice of
the better bookmakers to consider it as the
approved conventional page. Whenever it is
varied the guide must be a general sense of
appropriateness, having consideration for all
the other varied elements.</p>

<p>There are other rules. One that was much
in vogue at one time, and is esteemed now by
some good printers, makes the type page one-half
more in length than its width. This rule
is restricted in its application. It will not do
for a quarto page, nor for a broad octavo. Another
rule provides that the sum of the square
inches on the back and top margins shall be
one-half the sum of the square inches on the
front and tail margins. This is difficult to apply
in practice, for obvious reasons, except as
a test to determine the correctness of margins
already fixed.</p>

<p>The margins must be adjusted with the intent
to make the two pages lying exposed to
view properly harmonize with the book leaf,
and adjust themselves to the tyrannical optical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
demands of the eyes of the reader. This requires
a very strict and careful adherence to
rules well understood by good printers, as well
as a courageous disregard of those rules when
the exigencies of the case demand it. There are
many other things to consider. The general
character and purpose of the book must be
taken into account, the size of type, and whether
it is to be leaded or set solid, the quality and
weight of paper, etc. A bible, guide book, or
directory, need not have wide margins, nor a
book printed on small type and thin paper; and
a book the type for which is not leaded should
be given less margin than is allowed for a page
of leaded type. While the same general scheme
for margins is applicable to nearly all good
books, of whatever shape and size, when the
contents and object do not dominate the physical
character, it is obvious that the dimensions
cannot in all cases be fixed according to the same
formulas. A quarto page must have wider margins
than an octavo, but they must bear a like
relative proportion to each other. A quarto
page must be proportioned differently than an
octavo; it must be shorter by about one-seventh.</p>

<blockquote>The general
character and purpose of the book must be
taken into account, the size of type, and whether
it is to be leaded or set solid, the quality and
weight of paper, etc.</blockquote>

<p>The width of the margins must in some degree
depend upon the amount of white in the
page of type, upon the tone of the type page.
This involves the character of the type face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
quite as much as the spacing and leading given
it, as some type faces have such light lines as
to give the page a very light tone, even when
the type is set solid and the spacing is close,
other types have such heavy lines as to demand
wide spacing, leading, and wide margins,
to bring the tone down to a proper degree of
grayness.</p>

<p>Consideration of all these questions affecting
the format, and especially the margins, of
a proposed book lead to the conclusion that it
is good practice to select the paper as the first
step in the planning of a book that is intended
to be made upon artistic lines, and upon this
foundation to build the typography and the
binding, according to the rules of harmony and
of proportion.</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <h6>Chapter VI</h6>
<h3 id="ch_5">Color</h3>
</div>

<div class="p1">
  <p>In art, color is not essential to
some forms and processes, as engraving,
etching, charcoal work,
and the various forms of crayon
work; and in printing, it is absent
from the large percentage of work done
in black and white.</p>

<p>This limitation of the application of the
word "color" in printing is quite arbitrary.
If we speak in the strictest sense we must consider
that black and white work is color work.
White is the concentration of all the rays of
the solar spectrum, the epitome of all colors;
while black is the appearance of the substance
that most nearly rejects all reflections of the
spectrum colors; and black and white are as
truly colors as are red, violet, vermilion, or any
of the other brilliant tints. Yet as it is usual
to allude to black and white as some other
qualities than color, and as they affect us so differently,
it is deemed to be more convenient
to consider them in relation to light and shade,
tone, and values, and to confine the meaning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
"color" to the tints shown by the spectrum.
This is not an insignificant distinction when
employed in relation to printing, as much of
the beauty and power of the plainly printed
book page is due to the apportionment of black
and white—black type and white paper. So
when we speak of color in printing it must be
understood that the word is not used in its
broadest, nor in its most exact, sense; but in
an arbitrarily restricted sense, applying exactly
as it is applied by printers in actual practice.</p>

<p>The printer's understanding of color, his
appreciation of its usefulness and power, is approaching
toward the high esteem in which it
is held by the painter. He is coming to know
that it is a high quality of his work, and that
by it he is able to suggest several other qualities
that are vital, such as lights, shadows, perspectives,
etc.</p>

<p>There are no explicit rules for the guidance
of the printer in the use of color. There are
certain fundamental principles, and many rules
deduced from them, a thorough acquaintance
with which will enable him to avoid serious
blunders and greatly aid him in the working out
of a scheme; but that sense of rightness which
the successful artist or craftsman occasionally
experiences, cannot be won by the mere following
of the letter and the spirit of rules. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
true this is becomes apparent when the work
of the best printers is examined with intelligent
care, and it seems absolute when the meager
list of great painter colorists is reviewed:
Titian, Giorgione, Tintoretto, Paul Veronese,
Rubens, Velasquez, Delacroix, and a few with
less claim to the title. All that is known about
color has been absorbed by hundreds of artists;
yet out of a great army of successful students
there have come so few good colorists that their
names can be spoken in ten seconds.</p>

<p>To effectively deal with color a fair understanding
of what science is able to tell of its
essential properties and powers is necessary as
a basis. To this may be added such of the deductions
and rules as have been formulated by
the great painters and the students.</p>

<p>The important starting point is this: To realize
that color is not a material existence, not
a substance, not a fixed fact equally appreciable
by all and equally demonstrable to all. It is a
sensation; and a sensation not of the same force
or quality for different individuals. Of itself it
depends upon the waves of the ether in space;
for us it depends upon the power and truth
of our eyes. One may truthfully see a color that
is quite another thing to another person, if there
should chance to be a difference radical enough
or defects serious enough in the eyes of either.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
The laws governing light are of great importance
to the colorists. There are subtleties that
have important practical application which
cannot be guessed otherwise than by direct
reference to science. In no other way can a
printer know for example what colors are complementary
or what effect a certain color will
have upon another when they are used together.</p>

<p>There are many curious facts about color
which do not appear to be regulated by laws
at all similar to those we are accustomed to apply
in other matters; that there is this universal
and radical difference is of great importance to
those who use color in printing. It is interesting
to realize that color is produced by light
waves, the different colors by waves of different
lengths, or greater frequency; that red appears
to the eye when the light wave is 1/39000 of an
inch in length, or when the frequency of the
vibration is 392 quadrillions per second, by the
American system of enumeration. It may be
also of practical money value to the printer to
know such facts, and to always be conscious of
a fact more likely to be of practical use, namely,
that the sensation of color is produced upon our
sensory nerves in a manner closely analogous
to that which produces the sensation of harmony:
by ether waves set in motion in a different
way. These sensory nerves are the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
easily entered avenues to our pleasurable sensations;
far more delicate and responsive than
the different brain organs to the more obvious
consciousnesses, as personal regard and literary
appreciation, etc.</p>

<p>The printer handling color is making an
appeal of the most subtle and delicate nature,
vastly more so than is made by the type matter
that may form the body of the piece of printing
he is embellishing with color.</p>

<blockquote>There are many curious facts about color

at all similar to those we are accustomed to apply

and radical difference is of great importance to
those who use color in printing.</blockquote>

<p>There are three primary colors—red, yellow,
and blue—and three composite colors, which
can be formed by mixings of primary colors—green,
orange, and violet. It is of importance
to the printer to know which of these colors
are complementary and which uncomplementary.
Complementary colors are those that may
be used in close conjunction without one unfavorably
affecting the other. This is the secret
of complementary, or harmonious, colors: Will
they make white if mixed? This means a natural
and perfect union of the light rays reflected
from the color scheme upon the eye's retina,
and so passed along to the sensory nerves—the
telegraph line from the physical world to the
appreciative brain. It appears that those complementary
color schemes which can be perfectly
justified are such as reflect light rays nearest
like the rays that show us white. Red and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
green, the two most pronounced and vigorous
colors, are complementary. When mixed in the
proper proportions they produce white, but this
does not mean that they weaken each other
when otherwise used; when placed side by side
they enhance each other's power and brilliancy
by reflection. Their very intimate relation is
further shown by the fact that red, by itself, is
bordered by a faint halo of green, and green by
a tinge of red. Yellow and indigo also make
white by mixing, and easily reveal traces of each
other when properly manipulated. This interchange
between complementary colors is carried
still further: The shadow of a color does not
show the color itself, but the complementary
color to which it is most nearly related.</p>

<p>There is a curious law of optical mixture to
deal with—that tendency of the eye to unify
the color scheme which changes colors when
used in combination upon a piece of printing
or upon a canvas. This sometimes so changes
the expected effect of a color scheme that has
been carefully studied as to render it inadvisable
to use it. It is generally found that optical
mixture verifies the taste and judgment of
the colorist who has been faithful to the complementary
color laws, and helps him to a harmony,
rather than condemns his work. Optical
mixture is too nearly a mere name for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
manifestation of the relation of complementary
colors to trouble the printer, though a consciousness
of it and its effect may at times aid
him in producing some delicate effects.</p>

<p>The reasons for desiring reliable knowledge
of these qualities of colors are clear. Brilliancy
is obtained by using complementary colors side
by side, because each gives to the other its
favorable halo of color; and dulness of coloring
follows the use of uncomplementary colors side
by side because each partially kills the other
with its unfavorable halo of color.</p>

<p>Careful observance of this law of colors will
not give perfect harmony to the color scheme,
but it will give one of the more important elements
of harmony. But there is an important
exception to be noted. The law of contrast claims
attention, though it cannot produce harmony.
Strong effects may be obtained by ignoring
these rules relative to harmony, or by boldly
employing pronounced discords and seeking
to so mitigate the discord as to tempt the
attention to divide itself between the contrasting
colors. Red and blue in the national flag
are so tempered with pure white as to subdue
their fierce antagonism. And so it may be with
other examples—there must be either some
overpowering sentiment or some skilful expedient,
like breaking the main colors into lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
tints, to ease the transit from one to the other.
A good piece of color work need not be composed
of different colors. It may be composed
of different shades of the same color, or of tints
very nearly related. This requires a good workable
knowledge of perspective and of that rather
elusive and indefinite quality known in painting
as "values"; which chiefly means that each
tint employed in a piece of work shall be placed
as it would appear in nature and shall properly
harmonize with every shade or color in the
piece. Such a composition as this is difficult for
a letter-press printer, less so for a lithographer,
with exactly the kind of delicate manœuvering
that delights some painters. It involves such
fine discriminations as are necessary to show the
difference between a white handkerchief and
white snow, between a gray house and a gray
sky, between a green tree and a green mountain,
between a carnation pink and a pink muslin
gown.</p>

<p>It is well to appreciate the difference between
color and colors, and to recognize the fact that
good color does not necessarily alone mean the
degree of brightness or contrast, but is oftener
found in accordance, mellowness and richness.
Color does not always mean bright color. There
is beginning to be seen some low keyed color
work, simple in color composition. It is a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
sign. It is only the masters who are able to
successfully cope with the high keyed compositions,
and the masters are, as they ever were,
scarce.</p>

<p>The wise choose, when there is a choice, such
harmonies as may be indicated by mahogany
wood and Cordova leather; Indian red instead
of brick red, peacock blue instead of sky blue,
olive green instead of grass green; golden
browns, garnet reds, Egyptian yellows, deep
tones of brown, green, and orange. These colors
are not gay, flippant nor flimsy; they are dignified
and good style; they have a quality of
beauty inherent in them—a depth; and they
may be in keeping with a motive in the printed
piece that means something other and better
than a shock to the color sense.</p>

  <h6>Chapter VII</h6>
<h3 id="ch_6">Tone</h3>
</div>

<div class="p1">
  <p>No quality of printing is of more
general importance than tone.
It has great weight as a purely
artistic attribute, and it has a
great physiological value. If the
tone of a page of print is not right—if it does
not conform very closely to the standard set up
by the rules of art—it will not be "easy" reading,
and will severely try eyes that are not absolutely
normal and perfectly strong. Here as
elsewhere, and as is the unvarying rule, the art
standard is the standard required by hygiene
and common sense.</p>

<p>It is of the greatest importance that a printed
page shall be toned, with respect to the proportion
of visible white paper and black type,
in strict accord with the requirements of art,
which are identical with the rules that guard
healthy eyesight.</p>

<p>Tone in painting has a radically different
meaning in America from the meaning attached
to the term in England and in France, and it
appears to be less important. The American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
meaning of the word tone as an element in
painting is that it refers to the dominant color
of a picture; that is, as one would note that the
prevailing color of a certain picture is red, of
another yellow, of another blue. This makes
of tone a mere descriptive adjective of small
value as an aid to a critical estimate or as a guide
in creation. To the printer, this meaning of the
term would bar it out of his curriculum. The
English understanding of tone is quite different,
and it appears more worthy of acceptance. It is,
at all events, the meaning that must be accepted
by printers if they are to derive any benefit from
a study of tone as a possible aid in their craft.
The English consider tone to be "the proper
diffusion of light as it affects the intensities of
the different objects in the picture; and the
right relation of objects or colors in shadow to
the parts of them not in shadow and to the
principal light."</p>

<p>It is easier, and may be clearer, to think of
tone in a piece of type composition, or in a
black-and-white engraving prepared for printing,
somewhat as we think of tone in music.
And we find upon getting further into the subject
that it is expedient to take advantage of
the extreme comity at present existing between
England and America and let the two meanings
of tone merge into a more general one for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
the benefit and use of the printer in practice.
The painter's estimate of the tone of a painting
may be understood by applying a test cited by
a writer upon art: "If the canvas were placed upon
a revolving pin and whirled rapidly around,
the coloring would blend into a uniform tint."
The color tone of a painting must then be the
dominant color, modified by the subordinate
colors. If the color tone be yellow for example,
as it is in some of the good work of Dutch
artists, there must be enough yellow so that it
will be a yellow blur if the piece is spun rapidly
around.</p>

<p>In black-and-white printing tone must mean
depth of color, and diffusion of color, and the
tone can scarcely be otherwise than some shade
of gray. If it is advantageous to strive for a certain
harmony between literary motive and type
motive an appreciation of the technical meaning
of tone and the utilization of the unique
test suggested may be of great assistance to the
printer of black-and-white work.</p>

<p>The printer has to consider the tone of his
piece in a different light than the painter. The
latter has only his canvas to take account of,
and he works his canvas to its edge. The printer
has his page of type and his margins. This
blends the question of tone in a very practical
way with questions bearing upon the format—with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
the question of proportion for example,
and with the important question of the balance
of the margins; and while the determination
of the tone of the type page itself, irrespective
of the margins, involves one weighty question
in optics, the placing of the type page upon
the leaf involves another, quite different in nature
but none the less important from an artistic
point of view.</p>

<p>It is easily perceived that the element of tone
is of considerable importance in what is erroneously
called "plain" composition, the black-and-white
book page. In color printing it is
apparent that the knowledge of tone is of more
practical importance, as colored printed pieces
should show a decided preponderance of that
tone which best illustrates or translates the idea
that the piece is conceived for the purpose of
expressing. It may be important that a certain
piece emphatically presents to the eye a certain
shade of red. It must be just enough given over
to the red to produce the effect required—no
more, no less. There must be red everywhere,
but not too much. The simple test will show
the printer whether he is overloading his piece
with the dominant color or whether he has not
yet used enough. The color scheme must be
keyed to the required pitch of color, as a piece
of music written in a certain key must be kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
free from notes belonging to another key. But
not absolutely free, of necessity; short notes of
another key, and very few of them, may be introduced.
So a touch of a radically different color
may be thrust into a composition without ruining
it, as a bit of brick red or small patch of
blue in a monotone, or a little green or yellow
in a red composition, but not enough to show
plainly when we apply the whirling test.</p>

<p>This more obvious meaning of the term tone
seems to be applicable to printing, at least to
the extent of informing and modifying the mind
of the printer. The more important significance
of the term in painting means but little to the
printer, as it deals in modifications and gradations
in color not practicable in typography,
and applying, so far as printing in general is
concerned, to engravings.</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <h6>Chapter VIII</h6>
<h3 id="ch_7">Light and Shade</h3>
</div>

<div class="p1">
  <p>Light and shade means nearly
the same as the English idea of
tone, to the printer, as it has to
do with the distribution of light
and shadow in such a manner as
will best illustrate the motive of the painter.
This important element in graphic art has its
value for the printer. It is only necessary to note
the part played by light and shade—"light-tone"—in
any work of art to conceive how important
is its office in good printing, particularly
in the printing of the modern process engravings.
Some of the older Japanese and Chinese
paintings are nearly devoid of light and shade,
and are therefore given that appearance of flatness
and false perspective which is their distinctive
characteristic. Egyptian and Assyrian
wall painting, and many Italian paintings of
the medieval period, lack this quality, and they
sharply emphasize its importance in graphic
art. In nature it is more important than in art.
We can recognize no form except by the aid
of light and shade, neither a grain of sand nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
a mountain, nor any other physical thing. It
is probable that every piece of good printing
owes some of its excellence to this element of
light and shade; and as directly to tone. Light
and shade has reference to the proper proportion
of light to shadow, and of shadow to light;
not to the proper proportion of light to shade
in a composition. That is tone. Is there light
enough to supplement the shadow, and thus
bring the object illustrated into such reasonable
harmony with nature as to warrant us in accepting
it as a faithful picture of nature? Does the
composition, in other words, appear natural to
an untrained vision?</p>

<p>It is the persistent study of this question of
light and shade which has rescued the halftone
engraving from the pit of oblivion into which
it seemed destined to fall during its early days,
and placed it in the forefront of illustrative processes.
Probably the halftone of today, which
in competent hands is a superb and exact recorder
of nature, is not strikingly better in any
other detail than it was in its early days except
the one quality of light and shade. This variety
of illustration was as flat and as expressionless
as a Chinese painting until artist, engraver, and
printer conspired to give it expression and verisimilitude
by working up its capacity to bring
light and shade fully and broadly to its task.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
There can be no rule that will apply to this employment
of light and shade. Rules there are,
but they apply with truth only to one experience—that
which prompted their formulation.
The eye of the printer is the guide. This is the
reason why he should study this question, and
others of similar artistic value, from the point
of view of the artist, not from the viewpoint of
the printer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76–79]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
  <h6>Chapter IX</h6>
<h3 id="ch_8">Values</h3>
</div>

<div class="p1">
  <p>The quality in a painting which
is known as "values" may quite
easily be regarded by the printer
as signifying to him the same
as tone. Careful study will show
him that there is a difference, and also that
value is a vital element in his work which has
for him a real significance. Value may not unfairly
be considered to be an element of tone.
It relates to the intensity of light; not the brilliancy
of color, but the capacity that resides in
color to reflect light. In color printing the value
of the most common colors ranks with yellow
first, then orange, green, red, blue, and violet.
That is, yellow is capable of reflecting more light
from the same quantity of sunlight than any
other color, and violet less than any other color.
Scientists have reckoned that chrome yellow
reflects 80 per cent of light, green 40 per cent,
etc. These figures serve no very practical purpose,
because the reflecting power of any tint
is dependent upon the other colors employed.
Colors are dependent upon each other for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
value as well as for their intensity and their harmony.
It is not difficult to treat this matter of
value in a mathematical way, as is suggested by
Prof. J. C. Van Dyke: "Let the chrome yellow
with its 80 per cent of light represent a sunset
sky in the background; let the green with its
40 per cent represent the grass in the immediate
foreground; and let the orange-red with
its 60 per cent represent the sail of a Venetian
fishing vessel upon the water of the middle distance.
Now we have the three leading pitches
of light in the three planes of the picture," and
the problem would stand thus: 40:60::60:80
and the result will indicate the relative power
of the value in the picture.</p>

<p>Interesting, but not especially useful, the
"practical" printer says. No, not unless there
is recognizable in this, as in all that has been
said about art in printing, the subtle relation
between the vital elements of graphic art and
those refinements of knowledge and practice
which tend to bring printing nearer to the arts.
The connection is there, and is evident to the
seeing eye. In nature and in life the sense of
values is of such importance that without it
objects would not have relative positions; all
would be a jumble of shades and tones, objects
and colors; we would stumble, as we could not
see depressions; we would grasp an arm or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
empty air, when we attempted to seize a hand;
we could not judge distances. It is upon the
extent and the thoroughness of the printer's
knowledge of this question of values that the
degree of refinement and truth he is able to
impart to a certain class of work depends, and
hence its money value to him and its intrinsic
value to his patrons.</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <h6>Chapter X</h6>
<h3 id="ch_9">Paper</h3>
</div>

<div class="p1">
  <p>Paper is as important an artistic
or esthetic element in the well-made
book as it is as a technical
element; and it is likewise to be
regarded from the point of view
of the optician and the physiologist.</p>

<p>It is possible to select a paper for any book
that will lend itself to the artistic scheme of the
book. It has not long been possible to do this.
The product of the skilled paper maker has
more than quadrupled, in artistic variety, during
the few years last past, until it is now the fault
of its designer if a book intended to be harmoniously
artistic is not as true to its motive in
paper as in typography or binding. But it is evident
that paper for a book cannot be selected
without reference to the typography, the plates,
and other mechanical features. A grade of paper
that would be appropriate for the printing of
a rugged-faced type (like Caslon) upon, would
not do at all for a conventional type, such as the
Scotch face, it might be discovered, even though
the paper, in texture and finish, seemed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
peculiarly appropriate for the literary motive.
There are certain type faces which may be printed
upon paper that is milk white, and certain
other faces that lend themselves more readily
to the production of harmonious tonal effects
when the paper has a "natural" tint, or is thrown
strongly toward a brown color. Either of these
combinations, or any similar combination, may
harmonize unfavorably with the literary motive,
or with the scheme for proportion and
balance, or with the tone and values element,
and though admirable in itself have to be finally
rejected.</p>

<p>The weight and texture of the paper have to
be considered as minutely and as carefully, and
with the same principles in full view. A delicate
and shy literary motive must not be given
the massive dignity of heavy handmade paper
and large and strong type. Such a scheme is
harrowing to a sensitive reader's nerves and
rudely subversive of the more obvious and
elemental artistic principles.</p>

<p>It is a complex and an involved process to
select the proper paper for a given piece of
printing, and the rightful decision of either of
the component elements involves the rightful
decision with reference to each of the others.
It is impossible to consider the question of paper
apart from a consideration of the typography,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
the illustrations, the format, and the binding;
and it is not possible to consider either of these
elements apart from the literary motive, which
must always be the foundation of the structure.</p>

<p>Paper is one of the group of coördinately
important elements in a piece of artistic printing,
and only one, and never otherwise than
strictly coördinate. It may not be considered by
itself, unless possible disaster be consciously
and deliberately invited.</p>

<p>Therefore before the specifications for a book
or other piece of printing are otherwise fixed, it
is necessary to decide upon the paper to be used.
It is one of the elements of printing over which
the printer exercises no control except the liberty
of choice. He can choose the paper he wishes
to use, but he cannot adapt it. He can adapt his
typographic plan and his color scheme, and adjust
them to the paper in such fashion as will
result in harmony for the completed work, but
his paper he is obliged to take as the paper-maker
furnishes it. For this reason, and because
the paper is actually a foundation element in
printing, it is necessary that printers know about
paper, and that those who essay to execute work
of a high standard be familiar with its history,
composition, and methods of manufacture.</p>

<p>Too much importance will not be likely to
be attached to the history of paper, for it runs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
parallel with the record of the advance of civilization
and learning, and it has been an indispensable
factor in that advance. When we note
the important part played by paper in the complicated
scheme of our twentieth century lives,
we may gain some faint appreciation of its place
and relative importance as a factor of life. As a
factor in printing it has been customary to place
paper first in the list. It is a safe practice, though
the versatility of the paper makers is yearly
making it less essential to do so. Yet, when all
the progress in paper making has been considered,
it paradoxically remains that the selection
of paper by the printer is not the simple
matter it was only a few years ago.</p>

<p>With the progress of the art of printing during
the last quarter of the nineteenth century
there has come complexity in all its branches.
Type has been wondrously multiplied, inks
are in greater profusion, and varieties of paper
have rapidly multiplied. The good printer of
today needs to know the history of the evolution
of type, ink, and paper, if he hopes to be
able to cope successfully with the problems
facing him.</p>

<blockquote>When we note
the important part played by paper in the complicated
scheme of our twentieth century lives,
we may gain some faint appreciation of its place
and relative importance as a factor of life.</blockquote>

<p>One reason for this particularity of knowledge
is the tendency of the laity to study the
technical phases of printing. Type founders
have courted the attention of large consumers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
of printed matter and of large advertisers, and
the lay knowledge of type has led to a like
result regarding paper. So that it at present
happens that the printer's patron is able to
dictate the style of typography he desires, and
the quality and tint of paper he prefers. This
predicates knowledge on the part of the printer;
and in the case of paper it necessitates expert
knowledge. Type is type, speaking somewhat
loosely, and, whatever the crotchet a consumer
of printing may get into his head it is not likely
to cost more than about so much a pound. It is
otherwise with paper, and generally it is more
the color, texture, and appearance the patron
wishes than the intrinsic value, and the printer
must make a choice that shall satisfy the artistic
exigencies of the case, as well as consider its
financial aspects. One paper may be unsuited
for a particular piece of work, and another of
the same tint, weight, and price may be exactly
suitable; and the reason may lie in so obscure
a cause as the peculiar process of manufacture,
or the chemical nature of material used by certain
paper mills, or a slight variation in finish
that may affect ink in a different manner.</p>

<p>A bright and observing printer inevitably becomes
more or less versed in paper. He handles it
continually, and cannot avoid recognizing certain
more evident differences. What is learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
in this way is good knowledge, but it takes a
long time to get a comprehensive acquaintance
with paper, and there has not in the meantime
been built up that flawless reputation for good
work which all printers regard as the very best
capital.</p>

<p>The printer who knows about paper knows
about its history, its composition, and the methods
of manufacture. To him wood-pulp paper
is not all the same, and he knows what he means
when he speaks of "all rag" or "handmade."
He knows that paper made wholly of wood
varies in goodness according as it is made by
this or that process—mechanical wood, soda,
or sulphite; and knows that "all rags" may be
all cotton, or all linen, or a combination of rags,
or a combination of wood and rags, or indeed
all wood, or some vegetable fiber not specified.
It is not the mere exhibition of this sort of
knowledge that particularly signifies; it is that
it adds greatly to the printer's power to execute
good work, as it places him in a position to
select the most suitable paper, and insures his
reputation. It enables him to execute a piece of
work intended to endure a long time in a manner
that will preserve its beauty, so that it will
not fade or turn a dirty brown or yellow color,
as well as to make his paper play its legitimate
rôle as the most important inflexible art element<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
he will usually find it necessary to deal with.
A knowledge of paper in this thorough sense
is even more desirable if a printer presumes
to arrogate to himself the title and qualities of
an artist. It is scarcely too radical to assert that
the esthetics of printing depend for exemplification
more upon paper than upon typography.
It has been said that type, ink, and paper
go to the making of good printing. This formula
may be reversed and made to read paper,
ink, and type, since so much of the effect of
decorative printing depends upon the paper
and the ink. If these two harmonize properly
it remains that the type must not interfere but
must play the negative rôle of conformity. It
is the paper that is selected first, then the ink,
and lastly the typography is brought into the
scheme. Typography, as an ornate art, has
dwindled, and the skilled constructor of wonderful
effects with types and rule is no longer
esteemed in the job room. The arbiter of style
sits in the counting-room, and turns the leaves
of the paper and type specimen books before
the critical eyes of the patron. The job is built
upon a paper sample, and the designer sees it
completed in his mind before he sends it to the
compositor.</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <h6>Chapter XI</h6>
<h3 id="ch_10">Style</h3>
</div>

<div class="p1">
  <p>Style is that subtle atmosphere
pervading literary, artistic and
handicraft work that suggests the
cultivated personality of the author.
It is not a usual nor a clear
conception of style to consider the term as
applicable to inferior work. The word, as used
to designate quality, has come to mean positive
and recognizable merit, and generally also that
indefinite but powerfully distinctive merit indicating
individuality.</p>

<p>The word is used somewhat in this sense,
though more broadly, in descriptive art nomenclature,
as when the style of a Rubens or of a
Titian is spoken of; and in art it often appears
that the word is used more commonly to designate
a school or a genre of painting, than to
point to the work of any particular person of
the present or the recent past. Yet it is noted
that whenever an artist is able to attract favorable
attention through the exercise of talents
markedly his own, he is at once credited with
a style that is distinctively and peculiarly his.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
It is quite fair and just therefore to consider
that style in printing means that quality of
beauty or distinction which is to be directly
referred to the printer, rather than those meritorious
qualities that owe their existence to careful
following of established rules and principles,
concerning which all printers have, or may have,
a working knowledge. There are some printers
whose work is so redolent of a peculiar style as
to be recognizable to observing persons; and
such work has a quality that may almost be said
to be narrow. The possessor of a style pronounced
enough to have attracted attention is
also usually limited in his range; is, in fact, an
exponent of his own peculiar style and is but
little else.</p>

<p>Style does not absolutely involve excellence;
only a distinctive individuality. That individuality
may produce printed work that may be
wholly bad, or it may be the hall mark of a
supreme excellence. This is the technical meaning
of the word. In usage the word style is
generally understood to imply excellence, and
a high grade and peculiarly distinctive excellence.
The derivation of the word is suggestive
of the accepted appreciation of its scope.
It is the Latin name for an iron pen, but it has
come to signify not only the art that wields
the pen but it is applied to the whole range of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
the productive activities of man; to music,
painting, architecture, sculpture, dancing, acting,
tennis and baseball playing; to burglary
and picking of pockets, and to printing.</p>

<p>In printing, style is an element of value, and
may be accorded as careful attention as is given
to the type outfit, to the presses, or to the employes.
We can perhaps think of half a dozen
printers who have made great reputations and
considerable fortunes through having a style
that appealed singularly to purchasers of printed
matter. What is there in the work of Mr.
De Vinne's press that gives the name a distinct
value? Why do publishers announce in their
advertisements that certain books are printed
by De Vinne? Mr. De Vinne's style is valuable
to him and to the publishers who employ
him to make books for them.</p>

<p>Probably there is not an intelligent printer
who may read this who does not recognize the
value of style in printing, and who does not,
more or less seriously, struggle to acquire for
himself a distinctive style, and chiefly because
he knows that the possession of a style that
appeals to the buyers of printed matter is almost
the only sure means of gaining new clients and
holding old ones, and obtaining profit-making
prices. While there are many printers who will
be inclined to scout the idea that the possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
of a style of their own would be of financial
advantage to them, it is a fundamental element
in success. There needs must be some diggers
of ditches, hewers of wood and drawers of water,
and it is probably true that the great bulk of
printing will continue to be done by workmen,
a small proportion of it by artisans, and an
almost infinitesimal portion by artists. Nevertheless,
there is a gravitation toward the artisan
class, and from it to the sparse company of the
artist printers.</p>

<p>"The only way," says an acute literary critic,
"to get a good style is to think clearly." That
is in literature.</p>

<p>In printing, the only way to get a good style
is to know thoroughly. Yet it is not all to know.
The knowledge must be expressed, and it must
be expressed in a manner agreeable to those to
whom printed matter is to appeal. They do not
always know the point of view of the printer,
even if he has a style that is admirable. So his
style must, after all, be subordinate to clearness
and comprehensibility.</p>

<p>In a piece of printing it is necessary to bring
out "the extreme characteristic expression" of
the central motive. That is, if the piece of printing
is intended to promote the sale of a certain
substance or article it is desirable that all
the suggestive power residing in the types be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
brought into play to drive the motive home.
This is however a secondary quality of style.
The primary quality is that which attracts the
eye, and style for the printer may be limited
to those qualities that do most attract the eye
quickly and agreeably.</p>

<p>The secondary literary constituent of style,
which is harmony, takes first rank in printing.
The three essentials of printing style may be
generalized as knowledge, harmony, and expressiveness.
In literature they are thought,
expressiveness, and harmony, or melody, as
some have it. The greatest of these is, of course,
knowledge—knowledge of the fundamentals
which go to the making of the best printing.</p>

<p>It is not possible to teach style. It is almost
as impossible to acquire style. This seems like
a paradox, but a paradox is not always a symbol
of hopelessness. Style must be born in a
man—style in any art or profession. "Style,"
a writer has recently said, "is gesture—the gesture
of the mind and of the soul." We can eliminate
the last clause, and call style in printing
the gesture of the mind, the evidence of the
amount and degree of knowledge possessed by
the mind, tempered, arranged, given distinction,
by the born talent, aptitude, or whatever
it may be termed, which is the seed germ of
style. We do not hesitate to accept the obvious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
theory that artists are born, not made. Some
claim for printing that it is an art. Why then
should we hesitate to admit that a printer capable
of cultivating and expressing a genuine
style must depend upon something other than
mere knowledge; something deeper and more
subtle than knowledge, which is able to mould
knowledge into style?</p>

<p>Style, in the highest sense, is given to but
few, and we cannot hope that printers will be
more favored, in proportion, than the practitioners
of other graphic arts. But they may be
as highly favored, if they avail themselves of the
opportunities for culture that are open to them,
as they are open to other artists, and not otherwise.
While it is not to be expected that the
printing art will produce Morrises or Bradleys
with great profuseness, it is to be frankly admitted
that in the grade next below—the grade
of talent, that is, as distinguished from the grade
of genius—there is not found the high average
of attainment among printers that rules in other
graphic arts. The reason is as obvious as the
fact: Printers are not students, in the sense that
painters, etchers, engravers, illustrators, and
even photographers, are students. Printers (the
progressive ones) have in recent years become
close observers and good imitators, but there
are few who have attempted to qualify themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
for original work by thorough study of
those principles of graphic art that vitally control
printing. The artist, in any other line than
printing, comes to the practice of his art only
after prolonged study and mastery of the principles
and the laws governing it. Not so with the
printer.</p>

<blockquote>Style, in the highest sense, is given to but
few, and we cannot hope that printers will be
more favored, in proportion, than the practitioners
of other graphic arts.</blockquote>

<p>The time has arrived when eminence in printing
means much more than good work along
existing lines. It means a radical departure and
the full recognition of the power and value of
art in printing. We have been rather hesitant
in accepting this word, art, as applying legitimately
to printing, and we have been hesitating
merely because we have seen the term so freely
and ignorantly applied to work that merited no
better name than archaic; to work that, while
it usually possessed the common virtues of good
mechanical execution, was wholly deficient in
those qualities which fairly entitled it to be called
artistic. But we must put away this prejudice
against an innocent and needed term, and boldly
reclaim it from the philistines. We must reinstate
in the public mind, and in our own minds,
the thing and the name that fittingly describes
the thing. We must make art printing mean art
printing.</p>

<p>Style should be the goal of the printer who
cherishes hopes of distinction or of wealth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
We have said that style is born in a man, not
acquired by him. This is true, if we consider the
highest development of style. But we are all
capable of greatly improving our style by study.
We cannot improve upon it in any other way.
It is almost useless for us to observe the good
work of others, for this purpose. We must go
beyond that. The first step is to keenly realize
the need. We are on a par with every other person
who wishes to truly understand any art. We
cannot arrive at that understanding by merely
wishing it. There is no understanding of art
except through study of art.</p>

<p>We may spend a lifetime looking at the great
paintings of the world and then know so little
about them as to appreciate but a tithe of the
rich store of culture and pleasure they hold in
reserve for us. We may cultivate a taste for paintings
by putting ourselves frequently under their
influence, as we may build up a taste for literature
by strenuous reading. But knowledge, as
distinguished from acquaintance, gives us a very
different conception of a painting, or a piece of
sculpture, or an example of any form of art, and
reveals to us new beauties. So it is in printing.
We cannot do good color printing unless we
understand color as an artist understands it; we
cannot get the best results from a halftone engraving
unless we understand tone, light and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
shade, and values, as an artist understands them.
We are not sure of our ground with regard to a
page of plain type matter unless we know something
conclusive about the fundamentals of art.</p>

<p>We cannot take one pronounced step toward
acquiring style until we realize the need,
the vital need, of a good foundation knowledge
of art—not in a historical sense, but in a technical
sense—for the technique of printing that
is better than good.</p>

<h3 id="ch_11">The Binding</h3>
</div>

<div class="p1">
  <p>It is a pity that bookbinding and
printing have drifted so far apart,
since they are so intimately related.
A good book cannot be produced
without the coöperation
of both crafts, and that coöperation ought to be
of a much closer nature. The printing and the
binding of a book should be done by artists or
craftsmen actuated by a unity of purpose and
effort similar to the unity that must prevail in
the book if it is to express anything worthy.
In the production of books of a high excellence
it is necessary that the binding shall chord with
the general nature as expressed through the
printing and as fixed by the literary body. This
result can only be assured if the printers and
the binders work in close harmony. When it is
manifestly present in the book of today it is
necessary to assume that the agreeable result
follows the effects of some influence outside of
printers and binders, brought strongly to bear
upon each, rather than the result of a harmonious
understanding of the artistic proprieties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
of the case by either the printer or the binder.
Binding has a double significance: It is essentially
artistic, and emphatically a mechanical
process. In its artistic phase it rivals printing;
it is considered to be quite apart from printing,
in fact, since there is a pretty decided cult in
binding that takes no cognizance of typography
or of literary character. With this collector's
estimate of bindings we are not here concerned.
The desire to cheapen production has led to
serious deterioration in the quality of binding,
of the ordinary library editions of books, during
the past century. Machine methods, unobjectionable
when used upon very cheap books but
disastrous to the lasting quality of library books,
have obtained an undesirable vogue, and they
are so capable of cleverly simulating good work
that they have been a very active agent in the
decay of good binding practice. The results of
the more recent binding methods are extremely
lamentable, and those results have but partially
made themselves manifest. The next generation,
and the generations after the next, will
suffer for the sins of the binders of the books
issued during the last half of the nineteenth
century. The twentieth century may achieve no
more creditable record, but the sinning will be
in the light and will not be due to ignorance.
The English Society of Arts charged a special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
committee with the task of investigating the
cause of the decay in bindings, and the report
of this committee may be one impulse urging
publishers to require better workmanship and
better methods. This committee formulated five
specifications against prevailing methods, each
of which constitutes a defect of a radical nature
recognizable and curable only by bookbinders
or experts in bookbinding. Books are, this committee
found, sewn on too few and too thin cords;
the slips are pared down too much and are not
always firmly enough laced into the boards; the
use of hollow backs is condemned; headbands
are not sufficiently strong to hold the leather of
the back against the strain of taking the book
from the shelf; leather used is often far too thin;
leather is wetted and stretched to such a point
that little strength is left to resist wear and tear.</p>

<p>It must be noted in extenuation that at least
one of the counts in this indictment may be
partially condoned, upon the ground that the
fault crept into bookbinding practice with the
intent to facilitate the reading of the book and
not to cheapen its production. The hollow back
was adopted for the twofold purpose of allowing
the book to be opened easily and flatly and
to preserve the tooling and gilding on the back.
This form of back need not be always reckoned
as bad. It is quite possible to bind a book well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
and use the hollow back, and it is extremely
easy to use the hollow back to cover sins that
ought not to be condoned in a binding.</p>

<p>The life of a book depends upon its binding.
The leading idea in planning a binding for a
good book should therefore be to strive for
strength, durability, and convenience. To beautify
a book in its binding should be the secondary
motive. But the idea of beauty, through
harmony and the application of elementary art
precepts, may always be considered with the
strictly utilitarian processes, and the book may
be brought into close accord with the requirements
of art without any strain for art efforts
being apparent nor any economical or mechanical
purpose being strained or perverted. This
can be effected by arranging the binding to tone
with the literary and typographic motives, and
studying to have all details harmonious—such
as the lettering on the side and back; the design
of the stamp for the cover, if there be a stamp;
the material for the cover, its texture and its
color, etc.</p>

<blockquote>The hollow back
was adopted for the twofold purpose of allowing
the book to be opened easily and flatly and
to preserve the tooling and gilding on the back.</blockquote>

<p>It is manifestly impossible to put into print
specific directions for the binding of a book to
bring it within the meaning of the term "artistic"
while it does not depart from the ordinary
in quality or form. It is quite easy to perceive
however that for a book of a certain literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
quality a binding consisting of a buckram back
and paper sides is exactly appropriate, while a
cloth binding with a gilt stamp is obviously not
harmonious. If the title-stamp on the back of
a book is made of type unlike that used for the
title-page there is a jarring note that might easily
have been avoided. The motive of a book
should extend its influence to, and envelope,
every process necessary for its completion; it
should be as apparently in control of every
detail of the visible binding as of the typography,
the format, and the paper. It produces
an agreeable impression upon the reader if he
discovers this artistic unity in a book he hopes
to extract literary profit or enjoyment from—if
the typography, the format, the paper, and
the binding all tone to the same key, and that
key in harmony with the literary motive.</p>

<p>This much of art is possible for all bindings.
When they rise above this mere expression of
harmony, of unity, there is a widely different
question involved. Then there must be art for
art's sake, rather than art for the book's sake;
and of bindings that are in and of themselves
works of art we have for the present nothing
to say.</p>

<p>As to exactly what constitutes a proper binding
for a given book there may be differences
of opinion, especially if the inquiry be pushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
so far as to involve questions of art, or questions
concerning the artistic qualities of harmony
and unity. There are however certain
broad lines which may be indicated within which
worthy bindings must be brought, leaving plenty
of latitude for individuality in taste and in
judgment. What these basic requirements are
is perfectly known to practical bookbinders
and to publishers; to many printers as well.
They should be as familiar to the lay mind, and
every book should have printed somewhere in
it a clear statement of the specifications of its
binding. Its typography is visible; so is its format
and its paper. The vital parts of its binding
are concealed, from the expert as from the tyro,
and every purchaser of an ordinary book stands
to lose heavily if the foundations of its binding
are not honestly laid.</p>

<p>The specifications for the binding of a fine
book should show, then, that the cover material
is all leather of some one of the approved
sorts and properly manufactured, sheets carefully
folded, single leaves guarded round the
sections next to them, all plates guarded, guards
sewn through, and no pasting or overcasting;
end papers sewn on and made of good paper,
board papers of good quality of paper or vellum;
edges to be trimmed and gilt before sewing,
or left uncut; sewing to be with ligature silk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
around five bands of best sewing cord; back to be
as nearly flat as possible without forcing it and
without danger of its becoming concave in use;
boards to be of the best black millboard, and
the five bands laced in through two holes; headbands
to be worked with silk on strips of vellum
or catgut or cord, with frequent tiedowns,
and "set" by pieces of good paper or leather
glued at head and tail; lettering to be legible,
in harmony with the typography of the book
or with the decorations; decorations such as may
be wished.</p>

<p>These skeletonized specifications may be
modified in some particulars if they are to be
applied to grades of books below the best, but
great care and good judgment must be exercised
to guard against an extent of deterioration
which will bring the book below its standard of
utility and beauty. For library books, for example,
the covers may be half leather or any of
the several serviceable cloths; the end papers
may dispense with the board papers; the edges
may be cut guillotine and colored instead of gilt,
or the top only may be gilt; the sewing may be
done with unbleached thread and the tapes may
be reduced to four of unbleached linen; the
boards may be of split gray stock or of strawboard
with black board liner, and the tapes may
be attached to portion of waste sheet inserted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
between the boards; the headbands may be
omitted and cord substituted, or they may be
worked with thread or vellum.</p>

<h3 id="ch_12">Specifications</h3>
</div>

<p>The paper in this book is French handmade,
16 × 20–29, imported by the Japan Paper
Company of New York, and catalogued as
No. 333.</p>

<p>The type is a liberal modification of the Caslon,
12 point. It was designed and cast by the
Boston branch of the American Type Founders
Company, and had never been used until
set for this book.</p>

<p>The binding is according to the specifications
of the Society of Arts, of London. The sheets
are folded with special care, end papers are made
with zigzag and sewn on, edges are uncut, signatures
are sewn with unbleached thread over
three unbleached linen tapes, back left nearly
square, boards of the best black millboard, covers
of imported marbled paper, and the backs
of art vellum, with paper label. The binding
was executed by the regular force of workmen
and in the regular routine of commercial work.</p>

<p>The composition of the type was by a journeyman
and an apprentice, and the presswork
was done on a half super royal Colt's Armory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
press. No attempt has been made to execute
the work in other than the ordinary manner,
with ordinary appliances and ordinary workmen.
All the material is such as is regularly
carried in stock by dealers.</p>
